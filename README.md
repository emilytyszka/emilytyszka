## About Me
I'm Emily Tyszka (pronounced TISH-ka). I work as an Epidemiologist for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Syndromic Surveillance team, focusing on infectious disease. I was also formerly the Research Analyst for MADPH's Microbiology Division and have completed some work in physical activity among people with multiple sclerosis during my MPH.
